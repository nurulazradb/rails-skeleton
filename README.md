# rails-skeleton [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nurulazradm/rails-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nurulazradm/rails-skeleton)
I think most of us will use the same gems every time we start our Rails project. This repo is build to skip the steps to setup our Rails project with commonly used gems. This is an opinionated project and made assumption about the style and workflow when developing the Rails app.

## What's Included

The following gems are installed with this Skeleton:

* rspec-rails 3.6.0
* factory_girl_rails 4.8.0
* capybara-webkit 1.14.0
* database_cleaner 1.6.1
* shoulda-matchers (branch: rails-5)
* simple_bdd 0.1.0
* pry-nav 0.2.4
* pry-rails 0.3.6
* awesome_print 1.8.0
* devise 4.3.0
* rails 5.1.2

## Getting Started
1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:


    $ gem install rails

2. At the command prompt, clone Skeleton to your desktop:


    $ git clone https://github.com/nurulazradm/rails-skeleton.git myapp

   where "myapp" is the application name

### Disclaimer

This app will still be using `Skeleton` as module name as you can see in `config/application.rb`.
